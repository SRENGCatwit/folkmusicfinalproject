        <p>For my final project research, I needed to put my perspective as a folk music collector. These people do on-site research, ask questions, record, and observe. Going to Club Passim was my first on-site music research. We commuted from the green line all the way to the red line. Four of us had never been to Harvard Square, so it was a new experience for us.</p>

        <p>The show was called “Hazel and Alice tribute.” It is a collection of songs and not original songs. This is similar to Kurt Cobain’s MTV set when he played covers of other songs.</p>

        <p>The venue was smaller than I expected! We sat in the right corner where the musicians were closest. It was the closest I was ever to a musician.</p>
